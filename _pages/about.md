Hi! I'm glad to see you on my Data Science Projects site. ![me](./IMG_1094_min.jpg "IMG_1094_min")

My name is Kristina Pluzharova. I'm currently working as QA Engineer and I have 4+ years of experience in manual and automation testing.
Being a Data scientist was always in my carrier plans, so I finished DS course by Yandex.Practicum and now take projects to expand my knowledge and to get more experience.

Thank you for your attention!
